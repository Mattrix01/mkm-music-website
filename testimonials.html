        <h2 class="testname">Matt Ganim</h2>
        <p>“I worked with Matt on my very first album in London in 2015. Matt is a super talented producer who made me feel so comfortable and made brilliant artistic choices when mixing and producing my album. Matt is a total professional, easy to get along with, dedicated to your project and to creating something that you’re completely happy with. To this day I still send tracks to him to mix via remote production as I’m located in Australia and he’s in the UK. Years on he’s still the only producer I’ve worked with that carries no ego and is down to earth. Couldn’t recommend highly enough!!”

        <p>“"I've been looking for years to find a producer to work with who has got 
            the skills, but doesn't cost the Earth, and that is exactly what I have 
            found in Matt. He has all the knowledge, he listens, and most of all, 
            you can tell he genuinely cares about every project he works on. He has 
            added amazing things to my tracks which I never would have even thought 
            of! An absolute pleasure to work with - I would recommend him to anyone."

        <p>Matt Knight U.Ks brightest young talent. 

            We spent months researching producers to create world class music for our album and Matt totally blew us away with what he produced. His ability to produce music of all different genres to such a high standard that truly moved us separated him from the rest.

        <p>I have had the pleasure of working on Matt on three separate projects requiring VO, sound, music and FX.  I have found that in every case he has been quick to produce, had a good ear, was cost effective, and a total pleasure to work with.  He was also able to interpret creatively and product something better than I expected. I would have no hesitation to recommend him and will certainly continue to work with him in the near future.  Thx for all your Help Matt.
